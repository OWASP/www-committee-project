## Vendor Neutrality

Good OWASP Projects...

1. ...avoid names that are easily confused with existing organizations or their (commercial) services.
2. ...are truly free and Open Source and do not hide certain features behind any kind of paywall.
3. ...adhere to the ["Recognizing Supporters"](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/donations#recognizing-supporters) section of the [Donations Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/donations) when refering to supporting individuals or organizations.
4. ...have their own social media presence (e.g. Twitter handle, YouTube channel) and do not "piggy-back" on ones used for commercial purposes.
5. ...have multiple Project Leaders who are not all employed by the same company.

## Innovation and Purpose

Good OWASP Projects...

1. ...add something new and important to the OWASP ecosystem.
2. ...provide support for a clearly defined problem or perform a clearly defined task.
3. ...compliment but do not duplicate existing OWASP projects.
4. ...provide guidance based on recognised and respected sources be that OWASP or others.

## Community Support

Good OWASP Projects...

1. ...have a channel on the official OWASP Slack optimally named `#project-<name>` for easy filtering.

## Project Naming

Good OWASP Projects use appropriate naming which is consistent with the existing portfolio.

For example:

* A "**Top 10**" project will be designed to bring awareness to a brand-new or less well-known area and should be based on clear data or evidence. For example, the [OWASP Top 10 Risks project](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).
* A "**Maturity Model**" project defines a set of activities and processes and includes textual descriptions for ascending maturity levels of an organization for each activities/processes. For example, the [OWASP SAMM project](https://owasp.org/www-project-samm/) project.
* A "**Verification Standard**" project defines a set of standard and clear requirements expected for an application or process in order for it to be considered secure. Different requirements may be assigned to different levels based on the level of security required. For example, the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard project](https://owasp.org/asvs)
* A "**Testing Guide**" project defines a set of steps or tests to be carried out in order to check the security of a particular type of application or process. For example, the [OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-app-security/#owasp-mastg).

## GitHub

Good OWASP Projects...

1. ...live under the <https://github.com/OWASP> GitHub organization and not in private GitHub accounts.
2. ...can alternatively have a dedicated GitHub organization if they consist of multiple repositories.
3. ...respond to GitHub issues and pull requests in a timely and friendly manner.
4. ...have all Project Leaders as administrators on their GitHub repository (especially when it lives outside of <https://github.com/OWASP>).

## Website

Good OWASP Projects...

1. ...keep their `www-project-<name>` website up to date (especially regarding release information and project roadmap)
2. ...clearly state they are an OWASP project and link to their OWASP project page from any website they maintain
