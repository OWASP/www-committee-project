By submitting the new project request and clicking the box that you have read the project handbook, you and the Foundation hereby accept and agree to the following terms and conditions: 

1. The donation or creation of your project means that you agree to hand over all past, present and future contributions of 
    source code and documentation to the Foundation, however submitted to the Foundation, excluding any 
    submissions that are conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You. 
2. You hereby grant to the Foundation a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, no-charge, transferable copyright 
    license to use, execute, prepare derivative works of, and distribute (internally and externally, in object code and, if 
    included in your Contributions, source code form) your Contributions. Except for the rights granted to the 
    Foundation in this paragraph, You reserve all right, title and interest in and to your Contributions. OWASP will 
    always release a free and open version of anything we distribute that includes your Contributions. 
3. You may continue to be involved in the donated project, but you may not withdraw your project from the 
    OWASP Foundation once the project donation process has been completed. 
4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) have rights to 
    intellectual property that you create, you represent that you have received permission to make the Contributions on 
    behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the Foundation. 
5. You represent that, except as disclosed in your Project Donation submission(s), each of your Contributions is 
    your original creation. You represent that your Contribution submission(s) include complete details of any license or 
    other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) associated with any part of your 
    Contribution(s) (including a copy of any applicable license agreement). You agree to notify the Foundation of any 
    facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make Your representations in this Agreement 
    inaccurate in any respect. 
6. You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions, except to the extent you desire to provide 
    support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Your Contributions are provided as-is, with all 
    faults, defects, and errors, and without warranty of any kind (either express or implied) including, without limitation, 
    any implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and any warranty of non-infringement.
