  projects to achieve flagship level status, including deleting,
  revising, or establishing a project review process
- Evangelize OWASP projects publicly, including working with outside
  projects to become OWASP projects.
- Provide first level dispute resolution for projects, which can be
  escalated to the Dispute Resolution process or in severe cases, the
  Foundation, Compliance Committee, or Board.
