### OWASP Projects
Projects are one of the primary methods through which OWASP seeks to achieve ***No more insecure software.***
OWASP projects provide a community-based platform that allows project 
leaders the opportunity to freely test ideas and theories in an open environment. Leaders are able to leverage the 
OWASP brand, the community, and a dedicated staff to guide maturity. 
The goal of an OWASP project is to create a concrete deliverable - such as a document, a tool, or a code library - 
that furthers the [OWASP mission](https://owasp.org/about/). 

As with all OWASP groups, OWASP projects are driven by volunteers and they are open to everyone. This means 
that anyone can lead a project, anyone can contribute to a project, and anyone can use a project. This handbook 
is meant to be the primary reference for OWASP project leaders, and it should serve as a useful starting point for 
anyone that wishes to start their own project within the OWASP organization.

OWASP projects are divided into the following major categories:

### Types of Projects
* <i class="fas fa-file-alt fa-1x" style="color:#233e81;"></i> **Documentation**: These projects seek to communicate information or raise awareness about a topic in 
application security. Note that documentation projects should focus on an online-first deliverable, where appropriate, but
can take any media form (e.g. pring, CBT, videos, games, etc.).
* <i class="fas fa-file-code fa-1x" style="color:#233e81;"></i> **Code**: These projects provide tools, libraries, and frameworks that can be leveraged by developers to 
enhance the security of their applications. 
* **Other**: Some projects fall outside the above categories. Most are created to offer 
OWASP operational support.
