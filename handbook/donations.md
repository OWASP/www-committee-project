### Donations
Projects are encouraged to seek donations from third party vendors, members, and the application security community. Donors should be directed to the webpage of the project. When a donor clicks the Donate button from the project webpage, the donation will go to the OWASP project budget and it will be attributed to the project. For more information on donations, see the [Donations Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/donations).

You can also send a donation link through email or social media. The link will take the form of: https://owasp.org/donate/?reponame=www-project-webpagen&title=OWASP+Project+Title.
For the OWASP Top Ten Project that would be:

### Sponsorship
Similarly, projects are encouraged to seek sponsorship from third party sources. Sponsorship is generally considered material funds or contributions (development work, resources, meeting space, etc) which equate to $1000 or more and are, preferably, ongoing yearly. These contributions can be made in the same way as Donations, above, or through invoice by the [Ask to have an Invoice Created](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/12/create/44) service desk ticket. Project sponsorship, like donations, are governed by the [Donations Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/donations).

Project sponsors may recognize sponsorship by following the Recognizing Supporters section located on the [Donations Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/donations).

### Grants
Projects at the Production level or which have been designated Flagship may apply for special funding called Grants. For more information on grants, please review the [Grant Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/grants.html).

### Expenses
Projects will, from time to time, have expenses for which they may request reimbursement. Expenses for projects should always strive to be pre-approved through submitting a [Project Funding Grant Request or Pre-approval ticket](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/14/create/74). For more information on expenses and what is and is not allowed, see the [Expense Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement.html#fair-and-reasonable-expenses).
