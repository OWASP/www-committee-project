The following resources are available to projects. This is not a comprehensive list and may change over time. Except where indicated, a project of any level has access to the resources mentioned. Further resources may be found at the [Project Committee Resources tab](https://owasp.org/www-committee-project/#div-resources).

### Good Practices
The project committee recommends that projects follow these common good practices:
{% include good_practices.md %}

### Communication
OWASP maintains a number of useful communication channels for projects. The following methods of communication are recommended ways to get information out to the community:
- [Slack](https://owasp.org/slack/invite/) - specifically the #owasp-community channel though projects may create their own project-specific channels.
- [OWASP Blog](https://owasp.org/news/) - anyone can do a [pull request](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp.github.io/tree/main/_posts) to add a blog post which is featured on the [OWASP Home Page].(https://owasp.org/)
- [Project Spotlight](https://owasp.org/projects/spotlight/) - highlighted on the [OWASP Home Page](https://owasp.org/), any project leader can submit their project, write-up, and images to be featured.
- [Leaders List](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/g/leaders) - a Google group for OWASP leaders in general.
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/OWASPGLOBAL/) - OWASP's official YouTube channel. You can have project channels added to OWASP's channel.
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) - Zoom accounts can be requested via [Contact Us](https://contact.owasp.org/). These may be assigned temporarily for short-term use. 

### Cloud
OWASP Foundation maintains non-profit status with certain cloud service providers and has a very limited number of free credits through these services. Due to the limited nature of the credits and the relatively high cost of cloud services, the preferred method of using these services is through sponsorship or other donations to the projects. Further, these services are currently restricted to Production level or Flagship attributed projects unless an exception is granted.

OWASP Foundation has services available through:
- Microsoft Azure
- Amazon Web Services
- Google Cloud Platform


### Other

- Project Summit - From time to time, OWASP will invite projects to a special summit where project members can get together and work on their project without distraction. Watch for announcements in email and on Slack.
- [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com) - OWASP is experimenting with StreamYard; though this is typically a chapter resource, projects are not prohibited from requesting an account through [Contact Us].(https://contact.owasp.org/)
- [Contact Us](https://contact.owasp.org/) - Not seeing something here or have an idea? Submit it via the contact us JIRA service desk.
