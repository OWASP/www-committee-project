2. **Juice Shop** (OWASP Juice Shop): A deliberately insecure web application that demonstrates common security vulnerabilities, serving as a hands-on learning tool to help developers understand and prevent real-world threats.

3. **MAS** (OWASP Mobile Application Security): An initiative that offers comprehensive guidance for mobile app security, including security requirements, testing guidelines, and tools to foster a secure mobile ecosystem.

4. **BLT** (OWASP Bug Logging Tool): A developer-oriented tool designed to improve vulnerability management processes by simplifying bug logging and tracking, helping to foster effective resolution workflows.

5. **SAMM** (OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model): An actionable framework that organizations can use to integrate security practices into their software development lifecycle, providing a roadmap for secure software practices.

6. **CycloneDX** (OWASP CycloneDX): A software bill of materials (SBOM) standard that emphasizes transparency in software components, enabling organizations to assess and manage risks in their software supply chain.

7. **Dependency-Track** (OWASP Dependency-Track): A platform that helps organizations track and manage vulnerabilities in third-party and open-source components, ensuring a secure software supply chain.

8. **Wrongsecrets** (OWASP Wrongsecrets): A challenge-based project that helps developers identify insecure secret management practices and learn how to manage secrets securely.

9. **ModSecurity Core Rule Set** (OWASP ModSecurity): An open-source web application firewall rule set designed to help protect applications from a broad range of attacks, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.

10. **ASVS** (OWASP Application Security Verification Standard): A comprehensive set of security controls for web application development, providing a standardized way to evaluate application security.

11. **OpenCRE** (OWASP Open Common Requirement Enumeration): A project that bridges the gap between various security standards and controls, creating a unified resource for security practitioners to map and align security requirements.
